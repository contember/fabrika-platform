# references/files.md — file collections

A file collection attaches uploaded files to the rows of one table that owns a dimension. It is a section of the
contract with generated endpoints: no handler, no storage client, no URL of your own.

```ts fabrika.contract.ts
import { app } from './src/app-kit'
import { projects } from './src/projects/endpoints'
import { tasks } from './src/tasks/endpoints'

export const contract = app.contract((c) => ({
	api: c.rpc('/api', { projects, tasks }),
	files: {
		attachments: c.files({
			owner: 'tasks',
			read: 'tasks.read',
			write: 'tasks.write',
			delete: 'tasks.write',
			maxBytes: 5242880,
			types: ['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'application/pdf', 'text/plain'],
			maxPerOwner: 20,
		}),
	},
	health: c.health('/healthz'),
}))
```

The collection serves, for signed-in people only:

| Endpoint                                     | Access                      | Does                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /api/files.attachments.upload/:taskId` | `write` on the task         | the body is the file, `?name=` its name; answers `{ id }` |
| `GET /api/files.attachments/:fileId`         | `read` on the file's task   | streams the file                                          |
| `POST /api/files.attachments.remove`         | `delete` on the file's task | body `{ id }`                                             |

A file reaches what its task reaches, now: a moved task moves its files. There is no list endpoint yet; keep the file
ids you need in your own table or show the upload's answer.

## Its table

Each collection has a table `fabrika_files_<name>`, created by an application migration. Write exactly the DDL that
`fileTableSql` of `@fabrika/db` returns. `key` and each `chain` entry are `{ column, type }`, with `type` `'uuid'` or
`'text'` as the owner table declares the column, the nearest container first:

```bash
bun -e "import { fileTableSql } from '@fabrika/db'; console.log(fileTableSql('attachments', { table: 'tasks', key: { column: 'id', type: 'uuid' }, chain: [{ column: 'project_id', type: 'uuid' }, { column: 'org_id', type: 'text' }] }))"
```

```sql db/migrations/20261012100000_attachments.sql
CREATE TABLE fabrika_files_attachments (
	id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
	owner_id UUID,
	project_id UUID,
	org_id TEXT,
	status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'live')),
	object_key TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	size BIGINT,
	content_type TEXT NOT NULL,
	sha256 TEXT,
	original_name TEXT,
	created_by TEXT NOT NULL,
	created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
	deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
	FOREIGN KEY (owner_id, project_id, org_id) REFERENCES tasks (id, project_id, org_id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE SET NULL
);
CREATE INDEX fabrika_files_attachments_owner ON fabrika_files_attachments (owner_id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX fabrika_files_attachments_removable ON fabrika_files_attachments (created_at) WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL OR owner_id IS NULL OR status = 'pending';
```

- The owner table needs `UNIQUE (<key>, <chain columns>)`; `tasks` has `UNIQUE (id, project_id, org_id)`.
- Codegen leaves the table out, and no policy names it: only the framework reads it.
- The name is lowercase snake_case, at most 39 characters. `link: true` is not built.

## Storage

On Zerops, declare one `object-storage` service in `fabrika.config.ts`; the platform writes `FABRIKA_APP_STORAGE_*`
from it. Never read those variables, build a storage URL or import an S3 client.

```text
// in the services of fabrika.config.ts
{ hostname: 'tasksfiles', type: 'object-storage', objectStorageSize: 1, priority: 50 }
```

A test that boots an application with files passes `files: new MemoryFileObjects()` (`@fabrika/platform/testing`) to
`testKit`.
