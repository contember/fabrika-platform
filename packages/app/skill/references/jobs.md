# references/jobs.md — cron jobs

Background work is a cron job: `app.cron(schedule, { actions, scope: 'app' })` with its `.handle(…)` in the
`endpoints.ts` of the slice whose data it works on, mounted under `jobs` in the contract. There are no timers, loops,
`setInterval` or self-scheduled work, and no `ctx.jobs.enqueue`: work for later is a row that the next run picks up.

```ts src/overdue/endpoints.ts
import { app } from '../app-kit'

/** Marks every open task past its due day, hourly. A retried attempt lists again, so it marks no task twice. */
export const markOverdue = app.cron('15 * * * *', {
	actions: ['tasks.read', 'tasks.write'],
	scope: 'app',
	timeout: '10m',
	retries: 2,
})
	.handle(async ({ ctx }) => {
		const today = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)
		const tasks = ctx.db.over(ctx.within('tasks.read', 'org')).tasks
		let after: string | undefined
		do {
			const page = await tasks.list({
				where: [
					['overdue', '=', false],
					['status', '<>', 'done'],
					['due_on', '<', today],
				],
				limit: 100,
				after,
			})
			for (const task of page.items) {
				const ref = await ctx.ref('tasks.write', 'task', task.id)
				await ctx.transaction((tx) =>
					tx.db.on(ref).update({ overdue: true }, { expectVersion: task.version })
				)
			}
			after = page.next ?? undefined
		} while (after !== undefined)
	})
```

```ts fabrika.contract.ts
import { app } from './src/app-kit'
import { comments } from './src/comments/endpoints'
import { members } from './src/members/endpoints'
import { markOverdue } from './src/overdue/endpoints'
import { projects } from './src/projects/endpoints'
import { reports } from './src/reports/endpoints'
import { tasks } from './src/tasks/endpoints'

export const contract = app.contract((c) => ({
	api: c.rpc('/api', { projects, tasks, comments, reports, members }),
	jobs: { markOverdue },
	health: c.health('/healthz'),
}))
```

- The schedule is five cron fields, UTC. `scope: 'app'` is the only scope: a job reaches every value.
- A job holds exactly its `actions`. `ctx.within(action, dimension)` is a `Within` of every value;
  `ctx.ref(action, dimension, id)` locates one object (404 when it is gone). Bind them with `ctx.db.over(within)`,
  `ctx.db.in(ref)` and `ctx.db.on(ref)`.
- **Reads run outside the transaction; every write runs inside `ctx.transaction((tx) => …)`**, through `tx.db`, fenced
  by the attempt's lease. A write outside it is a type error that names `tx.db`.
- An attempt that fails or outlives `timeout` (default 15 minutes) is retried up to `retries` times, so every write is
  idempotent: re-read the state, and use `expectVersion`, as above.
- A bulk write declares `sql: 'write'` on the job and runs `tx.sql` inside the transaction:

  ``ctx.transaction((tx) => tx.sql(Marked)`update tasks set overdue = true, version = version + 1 where (…) and ${tx.sql.scope(within, 'tasks')} returning id`)``

  `within` is the `Within` the job minted (`ctx.within('tasks.write', 'org')`). The version bump is yours to write.
- `bun test --isolate` runs a job with `kit.runJob('markOverdue')` (`references/tests.md`). The platform runs
  `fabrika job run <name>` from the crontab it generates; never write a crontab or read `FABRIKA_JOB_*`.
- A job cannot create scopes, manage members or issue share links.
