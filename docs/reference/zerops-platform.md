# Zerops — the platform facts fabrika depends on

The subset of Zerops behaviour that the decisions in
[`../decisions/`](../decisions/README.md) rest on. Every claim carries a source.
Where a claim could **not** be confirmed in the public docs it says so — do not
promote it to fact without checking.

## Hierarchy and isolation

`project → service → container`. A project is the top-level entity: a **VXLAN
private network** with dedicated L3/L7 balancers, internal DNS, a firewall, and a
logger container. Services within a project share that private network and reach
each other directly by hostname and internal port (e.g. `http://api:3000/health`);
service discovery is automatic.
([infrastructure](https://docs.zerops.io/features/infrastructure),
[internal access](https://docs.zerops.io/references/networking/internal-access))

**Isolation is between projects, not within one.** "To connect to a service from
another Zerops project, you'll need to use public access methods since different
projects don't share private networks."
([internal access](https://docs.zerops.io/references/networking/internal-access))

The "service isolation" setting governs **environment-variable references between
services**, not network reachability — a service with isolation on is still
reachable by hostname from every other service in the project. The
cross-service variable mechanism itself is documented (prefix the key with the
service hostname, e.g. `mariadb1_connectionString`)
([env variables](https://docs.zerops.io/nodejs/how-to/env-variables)), but a
documented on/off _isolation_ toggle was **not located** in the public docs. The
load-bearing half — that nothing in a project isolates the network — is confirmed
by the internal-access page above.

## Public access

Services are **not publicly accessible by default**: "By default, your services are
not publicly accessible until you configure external access." Public access is
opt-in per service, via a Zerops subdomain (`*.zerops.app`, explicitly "not
suitable for production"), a custom domain, or direct TCP/UDP port access. The
project's **L7 HTTP balancer handles domain routing and SSL termination**.
([access & networking](https://docs.zerops.io/features/access),
[import reference](https://docs.zerops.io/references/import) for
`enableSubdomainAccess`, default `false`)

Whether **multiple custom domains** may point at a single service is **not stated**
on the access page — open question, see
[`../backlog/09-confirm-multi-domain-per-service.md`](../backlog/09-confirm-multi-domain-per-service.md).

## corePackage

`corePackage` is a **per-project** tier: `LIGHT` (default, limited redundancy) or
`SERIOUS` (HA). It "can be upgraded later from Lightweight to Serious Core, but
cannot be downgraded"; upgrades cause a brief disruption and are partially
destructive (logs and statistics are lost).
([import reference](https://docs.zerops.io/references/import))

This is why the default topology is one project per environment — see
[ADR-0006](../decisions/0006-zerops-project-topology-is-a-registry-field.md).

## The two config files

| File                 | Role                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `zerops-import.yaml` | Infrastructure-as-Code: projects, services, autoscaling, env variables, `buildFromGit`, and an inline `zeropsYaml:` object that supplies (or overrides) what would otherwise come from the repo. |
| `zerops.yaml`        | Build/run descriptor, normally committed to the app repo.                                                                                                                                        |

`zerops.yaml` fields used by fabrika: `build.{base, prepareCommands, buildCommands,
deployFiles, cache}` and `run.{base, os, prepareCommands, initCommands, start,
ports, healthCheck}`, plus `envVariables` on both. `run.initCommands` runs "each time
a new runtime container starts or restarts" (in `/var/www`) — that is where
migrations go on Zerops.
([zerops.yaml specification](https://docs.zerops.io/zerops-yaml/specification),
[import reference](https://docs.zerops.io/references/import))

A published JSON schema exists for the import format:
`https://api.app-prg1.zerops.io/api/rest/public/settings/import-project-yml-json-schema.json`
([import reference](https://docs.zerops.io/references/import)).

Caveat on `buildFromGit`: the documented form takes a **public** repository URL —
private repos fail during clone
([import reference](https://docs.zerops.io/references/import)). Private-repo builds
go through the GitHub/GitLab integration instead
([GitHub integration](https://docs.zerops.io/references/github-integration)).

## Zerops has its own CI

There is a build container with a real filesystem and shell:

- CPU 1–5 cores, RAM 8 GB (min and max), disk 1–100 GB; containers start at the
  minimum and scale vertically.
- The whole build pipeline has a **1 hour** limit.
- "Build container resources are not charged. Build costs are covered by the
  standard Zerops project fee."

Triggers: git push to a selected branch, tag creation (GitHub/GitLab CD),
`zcli service push`, `zcli service deploy` (deploy-only, skips build), a manual GUI
trigger, and `buildFromGit` in an import YAML.

Zerops keeps the **10 most recent versions** of an application and can activate an
archived one (rollback) from the GUI.
([build & deploy pipeline](https://docs.zerops.io/features/pipeline))

This is the single fact that removes the need for a fabrika deploy runner on Zerops
— see [ADR-0003](../decisions/0003-no-deploy-runner-on-zerops.md). The design
conversation also described the build container as Incus-based full Linux; the
Incus detail is **not stated** on the pipeline page.

## REST API

Base URL `https://api.app-prg1.zerops.io/api/rest/public`, Bearer auth with a
**personal access token** generated in the GUI. Endpoint groups relevant here:
`/app-version` (deploys), `/service-stack` (services), `/project`, `/project-env`,
`/user-data` (environment variables).
([REST API reference](https://docs.zerops.io/references/api))

**The personal access token carries account-wide admin privileges** — no finer
scoping was found. Treat it as a root credential: it is the single most dangerous
thing a fabrika installation on Zerops holds.

## Environment variables

Two levels: **project-level** variables, "available to all services in the project",
and **service-level** variables, including secret variants (`envSecrets` as a map,
`dotEnvSecrets` as a multiline `.env` block). Secrets are blurred in the GUI and can
be edited or deleted there. Secret and project variables can change **without a
redeploy**.
([import reference](https://docs.zerops.io/references/import),
[env variables](https://docs.zerops.io/nodejs/how-to/env-variables))

Project-level injection into every service is exactly why
[ADR-0004](../decisions/0004-secrets-live-in-the-platform.md) forbids fabrika from
ever putting an app secret at project level.

Whether secret **values can be read back** through the API is an open question —
[`../backlog/06-can-zerops-secrets-be-read-back.md`](../backlog/06-can-zerops-secrets-be-read-back.md).

## Alpine custom runtime

Zerops has an Alpine service type: "a minimal base environment for running
applications built with technologies that aren't officially supported by Zerops, or
for custom setups requiring full control over the runtime environment". Combined
with `run.os: alpine`, `run.base`, `run.prepareCommands` (which run in a fresh base
container) and an arbitrary `run.start`, a **static binary is a first-class
deployment target**.
([Alpine overview](https://docs.zerops.io/alpine/overview),
[zerops.yaml specification](https://docs.zerops.io/zerops-yaml/specification))

This is what makes the Caddy proxy deployable —
[ADR-0008](../decisions/0008-caddy-forward-auth-proxy.md). Since the project L7
balancer terminates TLS, Caddy needs neither ACME nor certificate persistence.
